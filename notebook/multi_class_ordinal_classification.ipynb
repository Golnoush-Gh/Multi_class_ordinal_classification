It's an important factor for runners to keep track of because it helps measure progress, build  endurance and improve overall fitness level. Whether someone is new to running or has been running for years, keeping track of their total weekly mileage can help them set goals and challenge themselves to increase their distance over time, leading to improved health and fitness.\n","- Hence, the total weekly mileage is the sum of the mileage of each workout completed during a week of training.\n","- E.g. If a runner completed 3 runs in a week, which comprise of a long run of 15km, and two other runs each of 5km, they would have a total weekly mileage of 15km + 5km + 5km = 25km\n","- On average, the total weekly mileage will grow gradually each week\n","\n","### Intro to long runs\n","- There are many different types of running workout, here we provide just the mileage of the long run\n","- The long run is the longest run a runner completes in a week, and grows week on week\n","- Long runs in running training refer to workouts where a runner covers a longer distance than they typically do in their regular runs, usually taking place on weekends. They are important for building endurance, mental toughness and improving running efficiency. By challenging the body to maintain a sustained effort for an extended period of time, long runs help runners develop their ability to run longer distances and tackle more challenging races.\n","- Their primary benefit is to build endurance\n","- In all the plans here, there is one 'long run' in each week\n","- On average, the long run mileage will grow gradually each week\n","\n","### Relationship between total weekly mileage and long run mileage\n","Taking the same example data:\n","\n","```{'ability': 'ELITE', 'runs_per_week': 2, 'n_weeks': 11, 'race_distance': 21.1, 'total_weekly_mileages': [21.9, 24.4, 26.9, 30.0, 32.4, 36.9, 38.9, 40.3, 40.6, 39.9, 42.3], 'long_run_mileages': [13.0, 13.9, 14.6, 15.8, 16.8, 18.4, 18.8, 21.2, 22.6, 23.9, 22.0]}```\n","\n","It can be seen that the runner has completed `2` runs in every week.
